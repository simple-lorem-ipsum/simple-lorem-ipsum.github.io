This extension provides a simple Lorem Ipsum generator.
It produces some dummy text for web developers to test form fields.

When using the context menu on a form field, you are able to insert some 
Lorem Ipsum dummy text. You can also achieve this using the hotkey 
- on Windows: ```Ctrl+Shift+V``` 
- on MacOS: ```Command+Shift+V```.

If you want to bind the hotkey to another key, please consider installing
[this extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/s3menu-wizard/).
